                So after this paragraph, you might ask: Ethan, why are you pulling up multiple textbooks at the same time to study the subjects you're interested in? Isn't that irresponsible? To that I would say: probably. Likely. That being said, thanks to the same friend, I've obtained a copy of "The Audio Programming Book." With "Signals and Systems" we're introduced to the math and concepts of how signal processing works alongside a few examples and some practical applications. With this textbook, we can apply this in audio using the C programming language. Don't worry, I'm not abandoning "Signals and Systems." In fact, going forward, I'm going to be covering information from both! And that's why I'm implementing a simple but useful feature in these blogs.

            <h3 class="subsection"><u>Subsections!</u></h3>
            <p>
                Hooray for subsections! Now if I create a longer blog post, you'll know where I'm just rambling about a textbook I'm reading and can separate that from the rants about, say, climate change. Speaking of which, I've been watching quite a few videos on the subject on YouTube which break it down, namely "Climate Change is An Absolute Nightmare - Here's Why" by UpIsNotJump and "Climate Denial: A Measured Response" by Hbomberguy (INSERT LINKS). Both are great resources, though the latter is certainly more sarcastic. I find it deeply unfortunate that people continue to deny the clear evidence on the subject and attempt to downplay or flat out reject any impact that climate change is having on our world. Furthermore, it's also upsetting to see that so little is being done to stop it by the major corporations and organizations most contributing to it. It introduces quite an existential dread, and I feel bad for scientists attempting to tackle this issue only to be dismissed or belittled. Anyways, this is just a blog from a teenager on the internet, so I know I'm not really having much of an impact saying anything.

            <h3 class="subsection"><u>Introducing C and Pointers</u></h3>
            <p>
                C, despite how old it is, seems to have aged decently enough. After all, it powers a massive portion of the kernel of the OS which I'm using to type this blog. That, of course, might change given Rust's introduction into the Linux kernel as an easier solution to implement drivers and stuff, but that's a topic for another day. C works incredibly close to the hardware and is easy enough for someone to learn by itself, granted you don't make any stupid mistakes in memory allocation. When working with audio, this means that it is quite efficient but also practical to code, which are two important facets of working with audio.
                <br><br>
                However, one of the technologies most used in C and C++ is the pointer system, which I struggled to wrap my mind around before looking into it some. So before getting into how C works with audio directly, I just wanted to demonstrate how pointers work on a fundamental level, and what better way than with a simple example? Fair warning that you should be familiar with the basics of C syntax.

            <div class="multi">
                #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;<br>
                <br>
                int main() {<br>
                    &emsp;int x = 15;<br>
                    &emsp;printf("The value of x is %d\n", x);<br>
                    <br>
                    &emsp;int *ptr = &x;<br>
                    &emsp;printf("The pointer of x is %d\n", ptr);<br>
                    <br>
                    &emsp;int y = *ptr;<br>
                    &emsp;printf("The value of y, dereferenced from the pointer, is %d\n", y);<br>
                }<br>
            </div>
            <p>
                So let's break this down line by line, leaving behind importing the standard library and creating the main function. First we created an integer variable <code>x</code>, assigned the value of 15. We then printed it out using the <code>printf()</code> function from the C standard library. That's self-explanatory. Where it becomes particularly tricky is when we start playing with the pointers.
                <br><br>
                We declared a variable <code>ptr</code>, but there was an asterisk or star (<code>*</code>) next to it. This designates that the variable is a pointer, and the type given that would otherwise declare the variable, is the type of variable that the pointer points to.
                <br><br>
                So <b>what exactly is a pointer?</b> It's essentially the address in memory for a variable, which every single variable has. Think of the variable <code>x</code> as a container in a warehouse. The contents of the container are the value of the variable, in this case the integer 15. But in a warehouse, you have a lot of containers, so you need an easy way to label them. So let's say they create spaces designated for containers, labeled 0 to 255. The containers placed in these spaces may change, but the spaces themselves do not. Let's say that the variable <code>x</code> is stored in space 129. If the value stored inside the container is 15, then the pointer for the container is 129. I'm not sure if this is 100% accurate to how computers work fundamentally, there might be a few issues with that analogy, but it's a decent metaphor you could visualize.
                <br><br>
                Then we have an ampersand (<code>&</code>) next to the previously declared <code>x</code>? This designates that the <code>ptr</code> variable isn't going to be assigned the value of the variable <code>x</code>, but the pointer value of the variable <code>x</code>. We'll see how this works when we receive the output. Speaking of, we pass the <code>ptr</code> variable's value into the <code>printf()</code> function as an integer, just as before, in the next line.
                <br><br>
                Now here's the coolest part. We declare an entirely new and unrelated integer, <code>y</code>. But we're assigning it the <code>ptr</code> variable with another asterisk or star (<code>*</code>). Given that the <code>ptr</code> variable stores the pointer for <code>x</code>, we can reference the variable value using that knowledge. In this case, that asterisk or star designates the value rather than the pointer itself. And from this, we can finally review our output.
            </p>
            <div class="multi">
                The value of x is 15<br>
                The pointer of x is -1749144944<br>
                The value of y, dereferenced from the pointer, is 15<br>
            </div>
            <p>
                Everything seems to be in order! The value of the variable <code>x</code> is 15 as it should be, the pointer value references a location in memory, and the value of <code>y</code> can be extracted directly from the information provided by that pointer.
            </p>  
            <h3 class="subsection"><u>Short Blog Today</u></h3>
            <p>
                I didn't really have the motivation to work too much further on today's blog, it took a while to make sure I knew everything else about C and the Signals and Systems textbook is intimidating me at the current moment. But tomorrow, I promise we're gonna make a strong introduction into both the math side of signal processing and implementing audio in C, because I have the full Sunday tomorrow to look into it. Playing The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild the whole time instead is alluring for certain, and I might pop in and out of it a bit, but it's not a passion project if you're not passionate about it. This is my passion project, and I struggle with motivation a lot of the time, so I consider these setbacks both perfectly understandable and also obstacles to overcome. I'm proud of the work I've done on this blog, but one thing I must admit is there's an astounding lack of technical explanation and diving deep into concept and application. If you disagree, good for you, but I would like to set my standards higher going forward. While I am writing this for the enjoyment of readers, my first priority is learning. That being said, it's quite late, so I'll be back tomorrow with an in-depth post! Have a good night, y'all!
