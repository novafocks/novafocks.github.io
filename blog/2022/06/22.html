                    After some deliberation with myself, I've made a decision: I am going to work towards developing audio plugins by the end of the summer. I figured that it would be something useful to work towards but also provide a sense of progression; I can start with simpler ones like filters and compression before moving onto delays or reverbs, or something along those lines. This, of course, will not come at the neglect of reading the concepts from the textbook. Speaking of which, my policy with those will be to read until I stumble across something I don't recognize, which I will then look into and clarify on my blogs.

                    Given that this is still a blog, though, I would like to give brief sections with small updates on my life. The latest one is a particularly dramatic internal conflict with plenty of deep questions and lore. So let's dive deep into it.

                <h3 class="subsection"><u>Two and a Half Laptops</u></h3>
                <p>
                    I'm looking for a new small ~13" laptop to have as a portable workspace. I have an Acer Aspire 5 from a few years ago that I got for school, and don't get me wrong it works completely fine, but there's a few things about it that irk me. Obviously I'm going to be doing web development with my website and all, working with data in Python, but also playing around with audio plugins in whatever language I decide to go with (likely C or C++ in some framework, likely has plenty of support and documentation). I'd store it all on GitHub (or even a self-hosted Git server, if I decide to try that), and sync it between that laptop and my main workstation/music production studio thing. I could install Bitwig on it and do some light beat creation! And I don't want to go above ~$800; I think that's more than enough and would make for a machine with longevity.

                    Where exactly I'm leading to as a good solution for this might be confusing at first, but rest assured once I get there that I have reasons. But before the strange idea, let's go with the usual subject: a small laptop from the major manufacturers, like Dell or HP or Lenovo. Particularly, the cheaper laptops from Lenovo's Yoga series quite appeal to me. However, as someone who didn't really like Windows 10, I am skeptical about Windows 11. The user interface is certainly an improvement, and I'm certain the user experience is better overall, but as time goes on I drift more and more away from Windows and towards Linux-based systems. Fedora is my favorite distribution because of built-in Pipewire and Flatpak, and just how stable it is out of the box.
