                    After some deliberation with myself, I've made a decision: I am going to work towards developing audio plugins by the end of the summer. I figured that it would be something useful to work towards but also provide a sense of progression; I can start with simpler ones like filters and compression before moving onto delays or reverbs, or something along those lines. This, of course, will not come at the neglect of reading the concepts from the textbook. Speaking of which, my policy with those will be to read until I stumble across something I don't recognize, which I will then look into and clarify on my blogs.
                    <br><br>
                    Given that this is still a blog, though, I would like to give brief sections with small updates on my life. The latest one is a particularly dramatic internal conflict with plenty of deep questions and lore. So let's dive deep into it.
                </p>
                <h3 class="subsection"><u>Two and a Half Laptops</u></h3>
                <p>
                    I'm looking for a new small ~13" laptop to have as a portable workspace. I have an Acer Aspire 5 from a few years ago that I got for school, and don't get me wrong it works completely fine, but there's a few things about it that irk me. Obviously I'm going to be doing web development with my website and all, working with data in Python, but also playing around with audio plugins in whatever language I decide to go with (likely C or C++ in some framework, likely has plenty of support and documentation). I'd store it all on GitHub (or even a self-hosted Git server, if I decide to try that), and sync it between that laptop and my main workstation/music production studio thing. I could install Bitwig on it and do some light beat creation! And I don't want to go above ~$800; I think that's more than enough and would make for a machine with longevity.
                    <br><br>
                    Where exactly I'm leading to as a good solution for this might be confusing at first, but rest assured once I get there that I have reasons. But before the strange idea, let's go with the usual subject: <b class="important">a small laptop from the major manufacturers</b>, like Dell or HP or Lenovo. Particularly, the cheaper laptops from Lenovo's Yoga series quite appeal to me. However, as someone who didn't really like Windows 10, I am skeptical about Windows 11. The user interface is certainly an improvement, and I'm certain the user experience is better overall, but as time goes on I drift more and more away from Windows and towards Linux-based systems. Fedora is my favorite distribution because of built-in Pipewire and Flatpak, and just how stable it is out of the box.
                    <br><br>
                    I don't really want to appear like one of those Linux nerds who thinks Linux is superior in every way; in many ways, mostly for non-technical users, it isn't. If I'm just doing creative and office work, which I would be doing a fair amount of, then Windows would appeal to me. But for development, nothing can beat the Linux terminal for me. The package management systems just make more sense, too. And I mean, of course I could install Linux over Windows or dual boot it but for one, I've never been a fan of dual booting and two, I'm more willing to experiment with hardware that didn't cost me more than most things. So let's move to my other option with that in mind.
                    <br><br>
                    I recently looked into <b class="important">Macs</b> for creative work and development, and honestly, they seemed great with both. After all, it is BSD-based, and so of course it's going to have a solid technical foundation. Other pros include: CoreAudio, general ease of use, still having a massive amount of software support, and one of the sleekest user interfaces I've ever seen. So what holds me back? Kind of like Windows but a lot less, I'm skeptical about macOS. I've demoed it many times in both my IT internship and at Best Buy, and I'm not certain if I'm a massive fan. Perhaps that's because I haven't really spent the time with it, and I grew up around Windows so that's what feels natural to me. Whatever the case, it's still an issue.
                    <br><br>
                    But that's 10% of the reason; the biggest one is cost. MacBooks get incredibly expensive real quick. Although you could argue to me that's a good deal for chips as powerful as the M1 in a portable format, and that's honestly completely fair, it's a beast, but they are just quite expensive new. If you say I should get it pre-owned, that's also fair, but most of what's on the market are older MacBooks, and Apple isn't known for caring about the longevity of their products in the modern day. You might think I don't want Macs after all that, but honestly it is high up in my considerations. But there's one last option I want to consider.
                    <br><br>
                    Okay, don't laugh, but what if I got a <b class="important">higher-end Chromebook?</b> Now, you might look at this and think: "Ethan, why? ChromeOS is locked down and restrictive, and they're mostly built for media consumption. They're good as cheap devices and Internet machines, maybe some web development for our all-knowing Lord Google, but that's it. Windows laptops or MacBooks for the same value will take you further." Fair, but here's a few counterarguments.
                    <br><br>
                    For one, while some chips are ARM architecture, there are many options out there with x86_64, like you'd find with PCs. Initially, that may not be all that impressive, because it's still ChromeOS. But here's the cool thing about ChromeOS: it's based on Gentoo. Again, not much on its own. But Google, in a strangely uncharacteristic stroke of good, allows you to essentially install Linux side by side with ChromeOS and integrate it. This, together with some having x86_64 architecture, and the major applications supporting that platform significantly more, means that we can integrate Linux apps as if it were just a Debian install. 
                    <br><br>
                    This means that VSCode, Obsidian, GitHub Desktop, Bitwig, all the applications I use for my work would... work. I've heard there's still some kinks to work out, but after working with Linux for a while you get used to having kinks. ChromeOS may feel restrictive without these tools, but if it's not technically restrictive for me, and at the same time I get an incredibly sleek user experience, then that's quite tempting. And there's one laptop I'm looking at in particular that I'd love if I were to get a Chromebook: the <a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/computing/chromebooks/galaxy-chromebook2/">Samsung Galaxy Chromebook 2</a>. I practically fell in love with its form factor seeing it in person at Best Buy. This was also after seeing the Windows options and "old" MacBook Air; it would just feel like a breeze and joy whipping it out to do finish some projects or explore new concepts whenever I need to. Like having a Linux laptop without some of the hassle.
                    <br><br>
                    I'm not immune to the fact that there would be a fair amount of downsides to this. Obviously, ChromeOS is still closed source and all and Google isn't known for their lax security policies; I care about that. Of course, the same could be applied to Windows or macOS. But furthermore, I must admit that my choice in particular would not be the most powerful one in the world. To counter it, power isn't everything to me. It's still one of the higher-end Chromebooks, I trust it to have an incredibly smooth experience, and it doesn't really matter to me whether or not I can compile things quickly or have my applications immediately pop up. I was raised with that mentality, specifically when it came to computers, and it's stuck with me.
                    <br><br>
                    That's the option I am most considering at the moment, but as always, it could very well change. Perhaps I find a Windows laptop that's similarly priced and I equally love the experience of using, who knows? But yeah, that's my life-and-death dilemma right now. But let's move on to something more technical.
                </p>
                <h3 class="subsection"><u>Frameworks Make the Bones... Work?</u></h3>
                <p>
                    So I mentioned how I wanted to work towards developing audio plugins by the end of the summer, but before I really decide on that, I think it would be smart to take an honest look at the frameworks which you can use for plugin development. And it gets even more complicated when you realize that plugin standards are entirely separate from the frameworks; it gets confusing quite quickly. And I don't really want to give detailed explanations for the standards. So if I want to support a standard here, I'll list it and give a brief explanation as for what it is and why.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>VST2, which is the legacy VST version, but it's supported by pretty much everything out there</li>
                    <li>VST3, which is the newer VST version with more features, and although it's not supported everywhere, it does have some nice changes I've heard</li>
                    <li>AU, which is exclusive to macOS, but I don't really mind that and I just want to support those that use Logic Pro</li>
                    <li>Potentially LV2? It's a standard which is often used on Linux, and is FOSS, but it's not as supported as I'd like by the major frameworks</li>
                    <li>CLAP? This is a newer one that, for all intents and purposes, just released and is still evolving; it's under a permissive license and serves to be the self-proclaimed new standard, and I hope it is because it looks dope and has major companies, organizations, and individuals behind it</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Now obviously, those standards with question marks aren't musts, and I can always learn with something simpler before transitioning, but I think it important to learn a framework that is widely supported because that's likely what you'll encounter in the field. So what are my options?
                    <br><br>
                    Biggest one is <a href="https://juce.com/">JUCE</a>. And oh my goodness, as I write this blog I discover that they are now supporting the LV2 format. That's incredibly exciting! But anyways, it's just a fantastic tool for audio plugin development. It's used for Surge XT, one of my favorite open source audio projects out there. This tool is most likely to be the one I choose, it's practically decided. But for the sake of fun, let's explore a few other options.
                    <br><br>
                    <a href="https://www.cockos.com/wdl/">WDL</a> is a framework from Cockos, the people that built REAPER (which is a fantastic DAW and is my close second option behind Bitwig). It supports VST and AU alongside the other standards which I don't care about as much. From the looks of it, it's supposed to be one of those "it's just clean code with which you can do what you want" types of projects, which I can respect, but I'm certainly not skilled enough for. At least not yet.
                    <br><br>
                    And we'll conclude with one that caught my eye as I was looking for tools: <a href="https://github.com/robbert-vdh/nih-plug">nih-plug</a>. Instead of C++ like the other frameworks, you use Rust, which I've heard is quite a pleasant language. It can export VST3 and CLAP plugins, which I find quite cool. Honestly, if I find down the line it would be fun to experiment with the way that I build plugins, then this one might come to mind. The only reason I become chaotic with my workflow, though, is because I'm in a phase where I simply don't know what I want. But when I find what I want, I tend to settle. Like with writing this blog and other programs: I wouldn't have it any other way right now than Obsidian as my markdown editor, VSCode customized to my liking, and GNOME with its elegant workspaces.
                    <br><br>
                    So JUCE it is, essentially. At least for right now. I'll start on my first plugin when I feel I'm ready with the knowledge I've learned. That could be tomorrow and I could be in for a rough path writing C++ code in JUCE while balancing it with learning C and signal processing through textbooks. It could be in another week, when I've gathered more knowledge that I want to translate. I have a feeling that many of my blogs are going to end with some variation of "time will tell" for as long as I'm still indecisive. So perhaps it's time to stop being indecisive and work on these projects as they are so far. I will learn signal processing, apply it into C, and develop plugins. Let's keep it there for now, until I've explored as much as I could.
