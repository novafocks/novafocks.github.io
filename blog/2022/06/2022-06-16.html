                    &emsp;&emsp;I'm not entirely certain how to start, so maybe just a simple hi! This is my blog, where I discuss the personal stuff that I enjoy studying, and this is my first blog post! Though I'm not certain how often I'll be posting, it's always good to start somewhere. Can it even be called "posting" if I'm just updating my website with a new HTML file? I don't know but I really don't care. So that being said, what is this exactly?
                    <br><br>
                    &emsp;&emsp;Hell if I know. But I'll try and make it into something, so to lead into a better question, what am I making this blog into? Well, I <i>want</i> to study signal processing, particularly in audio, as a personal project over the summer, and I figured making a half-blog/half-journal type thing would be motivating. If there's one way I love ensuring I know something, it's by explaining it myself.
                    <br><br>
                    &emsp;&emsp;So, to begin, I'll just say where I am right now. I have a decent amount of experience with Python, I've taken AP Computer Science A so I can technically call myself okay at Java (I don't really believe it), and I have a good enough grasp on calculus. I'll be honest, even if I muster up the motivation to work through this, I wish I could say I had better confidence in my abilities. Plus, I'm not certain where to start. And this doesn't even need to be entirely focused on "here's me learning signal processing," it's my blog and I can make it whatever I want it to be. So if I do keep this up, you can certainly expect some miscellaneous stuff thrown in. Perhaps too often, knowing my impulses.
                    <br><br>
                    &emsp;&emsp;I looked into the textbook "Signals and Systems" by a lad named Oppenheim (et al.), and oh God. So if I want to buy it, I'd expect to pay at least $100 for it. Used. Quite troubling to say the least. However, thanks to a friend of mine, I have <i>also</i> learned that the book is extraordinarily long. Well, I'm not entirely sure what I was expecting, it's a textbook after all. But thanks to that same friend, I can access said textbook! I'll be reading into it and starting to regurgitate some points tomorrow for the sake of my understanding.
                    <br><br>
                    &emsp;&emsp;In the meantime, I wanted to talk briefly about what I aspire to do with this information. I wish I could say for certain. Look, the music producer side of me really wants to create my own reverb plugin as a cool end goal to look forward to, but for all I know this will spark an interest in electrical engineering or machine learning or something. Whatever the case, I know that I'll learn a lot through this journey, both about signal processing and about myself. And I'm quite excited to do both! Time will only tell if I follow through, which I hope so.
                    <br><br>
                    &emsp;&emsp;Just before I end the blog, I thought it would be pretty cool to say what inspired me to pursue this. Well, I've been producing music as a hobby since I was 13. Although I've learned a lot, I haven't made much in the field of actual songs or albums. I hope that changes, but I often underestimate the difficulty of combining the creative and practical. I can hear what I want so clearly in my mind, and yet putting pen to paper feels so daunting. Through my time mixing and learning about how the music I make works fundamentally, I've discovered that I quite enjoy getting super, super technical. And what is digital audio except for signals in a computer being edited and processed? To add fuel to the flame, I freaking LOVE synthesizers. Learning how they work, bit by bit (if it's digital), just sounds exciting. So let's postpone the creation of a song or an album in favor of learning how exactly signals work and the cool things I can do to them. Maybe I can work up to building something I've wanted to build for a long time, or maybe I could discover a love for something I didn't think I had before. In either case, this is the beginning. I hope that I work to see the end.
