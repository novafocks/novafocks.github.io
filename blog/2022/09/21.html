                <strong>This was going to be the music section of an upcoming post, but since school is kicking my ass and I need to really take my time with the project I’m working on (you’ll see what I mean), I decided to make it its own mini post.</strong>
            </p><p>
                There obviously <strong>isn’t one</strong>. But as someone who’s been trying to make music for nearly four years, I’ve learned at least <em>something</em> about what it takes to make a good song.
            </p><p>
                Here’s a common trap I fall into often: a little something I like to call <strong>sound design hell</strong>. If you could recall from my first post, I absolutely love <strong>synthesizers</strong>; they’re extremely flexible instruments and can be applied to so many genres and styles. Their flexibility comes at a cost for me, though: sometimes I don’t know what I want them to sound like. So I endlessly try and program them until they’re perfect for the song. Don’t do this.
            </p><p>
                Another trap I fall into often is spending an afternoon working in my DAW and coming up with an interesting <strong>concept</strong> that I never formulate into an actual song. If you’ve listened to any of the songs from my “you need to start somewhere” collection or have made music yourself, you know exactly what I mean. This is apparently a common trap for producers, given the countless clickbait-y YouTube videos telling you how to break out of the loop of making loops.
            </p><p>
                The final big trap I fall into is thinking that if you simply have <strong>better tools</strong>, you’ll make <strong>better music</strong>. The only counterargument I have for this is to listen to any chiptune artist (hint hint, listen to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCC0a-WbVbyxXdgyB5Ki7jXA">FearofDark</a>, and please, PLEASE listen to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yu-Wqlnlr9Q">Windflower</a>).
            </p><p>
                Now I have <em>some</em> idea of what can make for a good artist: a lot of <strong>practice</strong> and <strong>dedication</strong> to their craft. This is relatively obvious, but there’s two reasons why this flies under the radar:
            </p>
        <ul>
            <li>People don’t really like being told that the answer to their problems is more difficult than they expected.</li>
            <li>It’s still relatively vague advice, and sometimes people simply don’t know what to dedicate themselves to.</li>
        </ul><p>
            The second point matters a lot more than you’d expect; people may want to be talented musicians in some form, but they don’t really have much focus. I’ve gone through that a lot while making the music I’ve made. There’s this instinct I have that I want to be able to say: “Yes, this is my song, I worked hard on it, and I’m glad people enjoyed it.” Who knows what it sounds like, though?
        </p><p>
            I started this blog because I wanted to learn more about <strong>signal processing</strong>, and I felt this would help me; in the process, it has helped me shape my identity, figure out how to motivate myself for a project, reignited my interest in computer science, allowed me to attend a hackathon, and forced me to come to terms with the fact that learning is hard but oh so worth it. All this is why I decided to add a section dedicated to <strong>music</strong>, I wanted to support myself on the route to becoming a better musician alongside being a better scientist/engineer/whatever-I-want-to-be-in-the-future.
        </p><p>
            So what is the secret to making good music? I, for one, think it’s the same as what I’ve learned through my pursuit of other subjects: <strong>make something and you’ll course-correct time after time until it’s just right</strong>.
        </p><p>
            I want to make a song, and I’ll start after I’ve finished this post. You’ll hear how it’s coming along in the next post.
        </p>
        <p>Have a great week, y’all!</p>
