          Hi! I'm Ethan, also known as novafocks.
          <br> <br>
          For as long as I can remember, I've been working with computers and technology. Surrounded by piles upon piles of desktops, there was so much to learn and all the time in the world to boot. That's where I gained plenty of Linux knowledge and passion for technology. 
          <br> <br>
          Thanks to my two brothers, vintage game consoles were a major part of my life as well. I grew up on Terraria, Garry's Mod (and Portal, can't forget Portal), Super Mario 64, Minecraft, and Super Smash Bros. Melee. I missed quite a few but you get the gist.
