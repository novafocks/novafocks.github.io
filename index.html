                <p>
                    High school senior and college student near Denver. I'm learning to create audio plugins with JUCE in C++, and also work with Python, web development, and Linux. I aspire to be a software engineer as an adult!
                    <br><br>
                    In my free time, I also sing, attempt to voice act, do parkour, make synthwave music in <a href="https://www.bitwig.com/overview/">Bitwig Studio</a>, read books, or simply learn something new.
