                    Currently a senior in high school in good ol' Colorado studying math, science, and engineering. I've been working with computers since I could remember, and through it I've become a Linux and technology nerd. Although I'm still discovering my passions, I hope to become an aerospace/electrical engineer or software developer as an adult!
                    <br><br>
                    I have a fair amount of experience working with Python, Java, and Git, and I hope to dive deeper into Python and C++ over the course of summer as a personal project. In the meantime, I'm also brushing up on my French and working on this website.

                    In my free time, I also sing, <a href="videos/scar.mp4">attempt to voice act</a>, do parkour, make synthwave music in <a href="https://www.bitwig.com/overview/">Bitwig Studio</a>, read books, and whatever I feel like doing at any given moment. I'm also working on a blog below, where I talk about my journey in studying signal processing, audio programming, and my life in general.
