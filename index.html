                    Hi! I'm Ethan, but you could also call me Nova if you'd like!
                    <br><br>
                    I love all things vintage, particularly synthesizers and computers. I work occasionally with Python, Java, and Linux, and I hope to learn Rust and more web development skills over the next couple months. I'm currently studying signal processing and electrical engineering over the course of the summer alongside brushing up on my French. Although I'm still discovering my passions, I hope to become an aerospace or electrical engineer as an adult!
                    <br><br>
                    In my free time, I also sing, <a href="videos/scar.mp4">attempt to voice act</a>, do parkour, play video games, make synthwave music in <a href="https://www.reaper.fm/">REAPER</a>, and whatever I feel like doing at any given moment.
