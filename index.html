          Hi! I'm Ethan, also known as novafocks. I currently live in Colorado, despite not really liking the outdoors much, except for parkour and bike riding. Otherwise, I've been a Linux and technology nerd for as long as I can remember, and while I'm still figuring out my passions, I'm currently interested in aerospace and/or electrical engineering. I produce music using <a href="https://www.reaper.fm/">REAPER</a> and <a href="https://www.bitwig.com/overview/">Bitwig Studio</a>, which inspired my love for synthesizers and audio signal processing! I also love singing, playing video games, and reading in my free time. I have a strong appreciation for art and animation, but also deep philosophical stuff and political debate.
          <br> <br>
          In terms of music, I love synthwave, EDM, most forms of rock, metal, some forms of pop, and everything Bo Burnham makes.
          <br> <br>
          Some of my favorite games are:
          <ul class="text">
            <li>Portal</li>
            <li>Half-Life 2</li>
            <li>Undertale</li>
            <li>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</li>
            <li>Terraria</li>
            <li>Minecraft</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

          For as long as I can remember, I've been working with computers and technology. Surrounded by piles upon piles of desktops, there was so much to learn and all the time in the world to boot. That's where I gained a strong passion for technology. Even then, though, I didn't have a computer of my own so it was my dream to have a machine of my own. I got my first laptop at around 9, and it was an older Dell Latitude, but combined with Linux Mint it was my own world and mine alone.
          <br> <br>
          Thanks to my two brothers, vintage game consoles were a major part of my life as well. From the Atari 2600 to the Wii, I played it all, and I loved it all. I grew up on Terraria, Garry's Mod, Portal, Super Mario 64, Minecraft, and Super Smash Bros. Melee. I missed quite a few but you get the gist.
