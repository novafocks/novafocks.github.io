                I live to see another day, and I am ready to start digging into this textbook! But before that, what other things have I been doing? I started reading DUNE this morning, even though I saw the new film just a couple months ago (and was thoroughly confused the whole way through). I approached my father and told him I started reading it, and all he could mention is how damn long that book was, and yet how thoroughly he enjoyed it despite that, or perhaps because of it. I've also been thinking in the back of my mind whether or not I really should put more emphasis on making music at this point, but to be completely fair I'm quite burned out. Not even from making songs, but from opening Bitwig and realizing that I don't got nothin' to work with; it's exhausting to be constantly reminded that perhaps you're not ready to put in the commitment and make that cool song you were imagining. But all in due time! For now, I want signal processing to be my focus, and alongside it I want to program some examples along the way.
                <br><br>
                "Programming examples" by itself sounds quite vague, and perhaps a bit like I'm overextending, but that's if I want to explain any aspect of the math behind it or how it could be applied in the real world. However, I feel like I'm using this as an excuse to springboard into talking about my complicated relationship with programming in general, so let's skip the filler and hop straight to that.
                <br><br>
                Like I said, I have some experience in Python and Java, and I personally feel the most applicable to what I want to study is Python. It's practically a Swiss army knife for working with math and data, and remarkably easy to get results from (at the expense of how long it takes to run, of course). That, I'll be using for the aforementioned "examples" and even for other projects where it works well, but where I'll likely run into a wall is when I want to program a project that needs to work lower level, such as an audio plugin.
                <br><br>
                Audio plugins are pieces of software that "plug in" to your DAW (digital audio workstation, which is where you work on your audio in a timeline), and come in a variety of different standards. Famous ones are VST2 and VST3 (developed by Steinberg, creators of Cubase and Nuendo), AU (developed by Apple), AAX (made specifically for use with Avid's Pro Tools), and LV2 (community run, and not exclusive to Linux but often used in that case). Many of these require the plugins themselves, or at least the core components, to be in system files, such as .dll's on Windows or .so object files on Linux. This pretty much requires you to work with a lower level language, like C or C++. Frameworks such as JUCE make this process easier, but you're still ultimately working with C++ in that case. Rust is becoming a more supported use case, but it's still quite underdeveloped. This means that if or when I finally learn enough to pursue working on actual audio plugin, I'll need to learn C++. It's not as if I don't already know a minimal amount and feel like I can learn it with time, but that'll still be quite the barrier.
                <br><br>
                Anyways, that aside, let's go over the very basics of what this textbook introduces. The preface states that this textbook is intended for undergraduate study in some engineering field, and I can't tell if I'm in way over my head or if I should just storm through what I'll attempt to learn. And here is where I'm going to begin to explain things, a common pattern you'll see in these blogs. It's mostly for the sake of myself.
                <br><br>
                The textbook is called "Signals and Systems" so it'll be likely worth answering what exactly those are. What is a signal, at its most fundamental level? From what I can tell, and I'll be screwed going forward if I get this wrong, it is a quantity that changes with an independent variable intended to represent something. And a system provides meaning and links between these signals by creating other signals or performing an intended action. To provide an example straight from the textbook, let's say a person driving an automobile presses on the gas pedal. The overall system, which sends signals and moves the person as intended, is the automobile, and the gas pedal is the means of which to send a signal telling the automobile to go faster. With that, I think it's fair to say I've earned my electrical engineering degree, thank you.
                <br><br>
                <i>That was just in the foreword</i>. Trust me, there's plenty where that came from. Expanding on the application of signal processing, it can be used to process data in particular ways. For example, let's say a person recorded audio with a microphone. There is always an inherent amount of background noise in a recording, but in this case it is loud and distracting. Using knowledge from this field, we can learn the pattern of that noise, analyze it, and process that audio clip to remove said noise. In fact, what if we took this a step further and gave the example of phones? In many cases, if you put a microphone right next to a speaker, it will create a feedback loop that causes the audio to grow louder and louder. So what's the deal with phones having the speaker and microphone right next to each other, and yet we don't have to deal with feedback loops? While I'm not entirely certain, if I remember correctly the solution was fairly complex but involved similar technology to solve.
                <br><br>
                These are <i>only examples with audio so far.</i> Seriously, there are endless applications for this technology, from images to statistics to biology. It's just math applied to continuous change with the help of technology. And that's why I'm so excited to learn about it.
                <br><br>
                After giving those applications, the foreword starts to mention "continuous-time" and "discrete-time" signals, which if I had to guess, is the difference between having a function which provides continuous results and a series of points over time. This is strengthened by the fact that they essentially say that as technology improves, the line between these two blur. <b>Note from later: this assumption was indeed correct. And quite obvious.</b>
                <br><br>
                Concerning these, just to be clear for myself, continuous-time functions are represented by <code>x(t)</code>, where <code>t</code> is the independent variable (implied as time) of <code>x</code>. They are also represented by a continuous line on a graph, kind of like what you'd see in your typical high school math class. Discrete-time functions are represented with <code>x[n]</code>, where n represents the nth point of the function <code>x</code>. These are represented by points on a graph, kind of like what you'd see in your typical statistics class.
                <br><br>
                The cool thing about discrete-time functions is that you can use them to represent samples of continuous-time functions, which is incredibly useful because computers process data that way. That's where having a sample rate in audio comes from; the strange number it is represented by is the amount of samples the computer uses per second. This means modern computers are typically processing 48,000 individual data points per second. Awesome.
                <br><br>
                I know that I wrote a lot and we didn't get very far, but I think there is where I'll stop for today. It's quite late after all, currently 22:44 at the time I'm writing. But first I wanted to briefly mention something I'm worried about going forward with this blog. Besides not being able to follow up on it forever, I worry that if I do, that I come off as pretentious with the way I write these. If I do at any point, I'm sorry. I'm quite enthusiastic about subjects which interest me like this, and the confident side of my brain loves to be dramatic in tone and verbose in vocabulary. That being said, I hope anyone reading so far is enjoying the content, and I'll hopefully be uploading tomorrow as well! Have a good night, y'all!
