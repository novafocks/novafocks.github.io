                So today's blog is going to be a bit different, because for one I'm not using Obsidian for a markdown editor and am just typing it directly into HTML, but for second, let's take a small break from learning something about signal processing or programming for today. I want to have an honest conversation.
                <br><br>
                There's this guy, Vinny, who runs the popular YouTube and Twitch channel/group <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/vinesauce">Vinesauce</a>. He streams video games, makes a bunch of stupid noises a lot of the time, and it's quite entertaining if you just want to unwind and listen to a full-grown man make Teletubby noises at the newest Zelda game. However, he's quite a shy and introverted person, and the only reason he feels safe streaming is because he can't see anyone watching. Sometimes the conversation does turn more serious, and if it does, he is careful not to overindulge. He believes that a content creator shouldn't turn their time for entertaining others into a therapy session. Frankly, I agree... but only to a certain extent.
                <br><br>
                I mean, to be clear, if you're just dumping information on your platform about your personal life and current events, then get a therapist. The people who follow you should not be obligated to deal with that; trained professionals should. Then again, putting your voice out there requires a certain level of understanding from the people who listen to you. If not, you'd just be another person on the Internet. I mentioned a while back that I was worried I'm not keeping up with my content enough. And I think that should have some context.
            </p>
            <h3 class="subsection"><u>Some Context</u></h3>
            <p>
                I'm not going to go deep into some <i>dark past kept secret for years</i>, because firstly, I don't really have that, but secondly, that's kind of my business. That being said, I know I've continually said "hey, I'm pushing myself for the sake of talking about signal processing," but it's difficult to not come to that conclusion when I sit down after my part-time job every afternoon and think: I know that I want to learn this, but there's an impending stress that I have to deliver. Yet I'm tired, so it's difficult to find the motivation. But I know myself better to say that it would be difficult to find motivation regardless of whether or not I had that job.
                <br><br>
                What I ultimately want to get to is that I care about ensuring this blog continues, and I care deeply. I've loved learning about signal processing so far. I already said I'm trying to balance this with my personal life, and I am trying to do that still. But I also forget that this is still a blog, and it can be what I want it to be. Maybe I just want to share something cool that happened that day and add a small section at the end with some math. Perhaps I'm particularly motivated and want to share more. What if, one day, I was in the mood to start a more long-term project that would span quite a few blogs?
                <br><br>
                The reason I say all that is to state that this stress is self-made, and I know that when I don't feel obligated to do something large or even mostly math-related, that I will feel more free to do what I want. And oftentimes, what I want <i>are</i> often those projects or informative blogs.
                <br><br>
                In either case, tomorrow's blog will be more math related. I can't promise a long post like yesterday, of course, and I don't want to put that pressure on myself. But if I do want to write a longer post, that's what I'll do! If I were to describe what exactly I feel like doing tomorrow, it's to demonstrate something I know by applying it to a real-world project. Anyways, it's getting quite late, so I'm going to pick up on creating my new post tomorrow. Have a good night, y'all!
