                So I purchased Komplete 12 a while back and completely forgot ever since I switched to Linux for my music work. Now that I have a MacBook which I bring around with me, I'm beginning to rediscover the value of the paid tools that I bought (which I really should've put more thought into back then, but I was a much more impulsive spender at that time). 
                <br><br>
                And since I'm trying to learn more about DSP, but I'm getting caught up in not just the math but the structure of trying to create plugins, I find myself in an annoying dillemma where I have to lighten the load on one and put off my goal or simply suffer with the weight of both for a while. Yet, I couldn't really think of a way to learn the math side with ease besides learning the theory and applying them in plugins. Until now.
                <br><br>
                Enter <b>Reaktor.</b> It's a fairly old piece of software from Native Instruments (who are now mostly putting out gimmick plugins, unfortunately; they had a lot of gems like Absynth and Kontakt) which was intended to be a deep DSP playground. Not only does it emulate a Eurorack-like environment with Blocks as introduced in version 6, but you can create your own synthesizers and effects, either using their built-in DSP tools or just creating them yourself from scratch using math! I completely forgot this existed but I'm so glad I remembered it, because this could help a metric ton with my learning curve. Hell, since the music I love making involve so much synthesis and it has an absurd amount of built-in effects and synthesizers alongside endless user content, I could just have this software installed and create multiple albums with its capabilities. That's how good it is. 
                <br><br>
                Additionally, there's a different tool that I discovered which I think could be a similar type of jungle gym for DSP: <b>Faust</b>. It's a programming language designed specifically for the purpose and can compile to many different formats, including plugins! That already intrigued me, so I figured why not bring it up so I could store it in my toolbox and potentially incorporate it into a blog post? Although <b>Reaktor</b> will <i>likely</i> be my main tool because of its massive community and detailed documentation, I see no reason to discard this one, so potentially expect a few cameos in the future. 
                <br><br>
                But for this blog, I need to introduce myself to some key mathematical concepts that come with DSP design (hopefully leading up to learning how filters work), and there's a lot of them, so strap in.
            </p>
            <h3 class="subsection"><u>Linear Systems and the Fundamental Concept of DSP</u></h3>
            <p>
                So what exactly is a linear system in DSP? Remembering that a system deals with signals by taking an input and creating an output as a result, then <b>linear</b> is a property that can be assigned to a system if its results fall into certain parameters. Otherwise, it would be <b>non-linear</b>.
                <br><br>
                In order for a system to be considered linear, it must have two mathematical properties: <b>homogeneity</b> and <b>additivity</b>. So what do those mean? In order for a system to have <b>homogeneity</b>, then a change in the amplitude of the input signal must correspond to an <i>equal</i> change in amplitude for the output signal. Let's say we have an input of a sine wave into a system, which outputs a cosine wave. If we amplify the input wave by a factor of two, the output wave must also be amplified by a factor of two. This system has <b>homogeneity</b>. If the output wave amplified by a factor of four as a response to an input amplification by a factor of two, then the system <b>would not have homogeneity</b>.
                <br><br>
                <b>Additivity</b> is a little bit more self-explanatory. Let's say we have two input signals, which we'll call x<sub>1</sub>[n] and x<sub>2</sub>[n]. We input these signals into the same exact system, which gives output signals of y<sub>1</sub>[n] and y<sub>2</sub>[n] respectively. This system would have <b>additivity</b> if when you input the signal of x<sub>1</sub>[n] + x<sub>2</sub>[n], you receive an output which is equal to y<sub>1</sub>[n] + y<sub>2</sub>[n].
                <br><br>
                When a system has these two properties, it is considered a <b>linear system</b>. Examples of this include amplification and attenuation of a signal, convolutions, echoes, and many others. Systems which don't have both of these properties, <b>non-linear systems</b>, include distortion and saturation (including overdriving of analog circuitry), multiplication of a signal by another signal, or systems that include thresholds, such as gates which do not allow output unless the amplitude, for example, has reached a certain level. 
                <br><br>
                Sprinkled into all that jargon was, fun fact, the <b>fundamental concept of DSP</b>. It's called <b>superposition</b>, and it was the foundation of the <b>additivity</b> property I just described; signals can be defined as sums of simpler waveforms, and as such we can use simple signals to understand how signals are changed by systems. This is the foundation of basically every signal processing technique.
                <br><br>
                Adversely, the concept of <b>decomposition</b> is understanding that complex signals can be created through sums of simpler signals, and using that knowledge to break down said signals. Quite fascinating!
                <br><br>
                We can use this knowledge to introduce a new concept which is equally fundamental for the field, but I want to introduce it with an example you're likely familiar with.
                <br><br>
                If you've used a DAW to make music before, you're likely familiar with <b>convolution reverb</b> plugins. They take a sound file of a space, sometimes with specialized audio file types, and the plugin transforms it into a reverb effect using magic. Now you can use a Lexicon 480L without even owning one!
                <br><br>
                But <b>convolution</b> is essential to the world of DSP because it builds directly upon <b>superposition</b> and directly applies it: it is the mathematical way to combine two signals to form a third signal. However, strangely enough, it can refer to the mathematical process or the result of it. But oh well, that's not all that important.
                <br><br>
                If you wanted to calculate it mathematically, Google provides the formula if you search it, so here it is alongside a key of the variables.
            </p>

            <p>
                What does this imply? Similarly to the concept of <b>superposition</b>, this allows you to break down signals into multiple, often simpler functions, and well you already know the technology that led to. 
                <br><br>
                But where do the acronyms <b>FFT</b>,<b>FIR</b>, and <b>IIR</b> draw from these concepts, and what do they mean? Well, I think that's best saved for next time because they deserve their own space entirely.
                <br><br>
                <b>Editor's note: this section took much longer than expected because I was planning to apply this to digital filters in Reaktor in this very post... turns out that was well above my pay grade. If you want a reason (or excuse) for me not releasing new content earlier, then it's my stubbornness. I suppose it teaches me a humbling lesson about not reaching too far.</b>
            </p>
            <h3 class="subsection"><u>Upgrading Website, SAT Practice, and Vacation</u></h3>
            <p>
                I think the website needs at least a small upgrade. Don't get me wrong, I love how I've styled it with Fira Sans and the gruvbox color scheme and the round, flat look, but there could be a little more updating to make it feel more complete. Mainly what I want to implement is a <b>navigation bar</b> on the top so you can easily see all that's available on my website without it being all cryptic. 
                <br><br>
                Additionally, I've signed up to take the SAT again in August, increasing my time on Khan Academy by a significant margin. This means I might have less time to spend on my blog and more time studying, yet again. I will still post however much I can, but I must prioritize as important things come up in my life, and I don't want to waste the opportunities given to me.
                <br><br>
                This isn't helped by the fact that me and my family are going on vacation in the first week of August. While I will try to make posts or at least work on a mega-blog for release when I return (though I'm not <i>promising</i> that because I know where that gets me), I cannot guarantee anything around then.
                <br><br>
                I sincerely apologize for all those inconveniences, but yeah, life is still happening and I don't want to miss it. I enjoy writing for this, though, and it's going to continue to be a passion of mine going forward; I'm so happy about this being a successful project so far. Speaking of which, I started it approximately <b>one month ago</b>, and looking back, I've made much more progress than I thought I would. And it's proven to me that I can be self-motivated in my learning, and growing up with ADHD that was a particularly difficult skill to attain, so I'm overjoyed that I could prove that to myself. Even if this doesn't really go anywhere besides me learning a lot, at least I know that I can branch out on my own with intent and content myself.
                <br><br>
                As for the next blog? I'm not certain. It'll be whatever I'm passionate about doing, whatever that may be. Until then, I wish y'all the best, and have a great night!
