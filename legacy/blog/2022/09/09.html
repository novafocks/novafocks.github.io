                <hr class="divider">
                <p>Before I get to the main content, I wanted to make a small personal
                announcement/self-promotion.</p>
                <a href="https://novafocks.bandcamp.com/"><h3 class="subsection">“you need to start
                somewhere” Collection (Link to Bandcamp)</h3></a>
                <p>I’ve released ten songs under the name “you need to start somewhere”
                on YouTube and Bandcamp. While this is technically an album, I like to
                consider it a simple compilation of <strong>unfinished</strong> stuff
                I’ve created throughout the years. And I must stress the
                <strong>unfinished</strong> part. I created most of these songs in an
                afternoon, and only a couple took me a week or so.</p>
                <p>You might ask why I’ve released a bunch of insignificant experiments
                this way. To put the songs I’ve chosen into perspective, I have
                <strong>hundreds more</strong> of these lying around on my hard drive,
                and I think that having all these is pretty important to the process of
                making music. <strong>You need to start somewhere</strong>, after all,
                and those songs are the best of all the experiments. It’s a transparent
                way of demonstrating my growth, to show where I am now with the
                knowledge that I once knew nothing.</p>
                <p>But without further ado, let me present the most important part of
                this post: the <strong>PennApps XXIII hackathon</strong>, and what I
                learned from it.</p>
                <h3 class="subsection">PennApps XXIII</h3>
                <p>So this was originally going to be a video that I posted on my
                YouTube channel, but school has gotten me busy as hell recently, so I
                figured I’ll write about it instead.</p>
                <p>For those who aren’t aware, <strong>PennApps XXIII</strong> is a
                hackathon at the University of Pennsylvania that someone made the
                mistake of inviting me to; it was a mistake not because it wasn’t good,
                it was amazing, but because I’m not certain I was qualified.</p>
                <p>Flying on your own for the first time is a little terrifying. It
                didn’t help that the only option available for the times I wanted was
                <strong>Frontier</strong>. A no-frills flight, but the seats were
                extremely uncomfortable and I couldn’t get any sleep. Not good for a
                midnight flight.</p>
                <p>Luckily I found enough energy to function going into the morning, and
                I took the train to the university district of Philadelphia. And oh God
                was it bigger than I expected. The city was beautiful, with a gorgeous
                spectacle of tall, modern buildings, and the air was as fresh as you
                could expect.</p>
                <p>But let me tell you about the campus. I couldn’t believe that it was
                that massive. A winding walkway took you from one side to the other,
                decorated with trees and archaic-looking houses; a perfect blend between
                the <strong>colonial</strong> and the <strong>modern</strong>. I’m
                certain there’s another half I didn’t have the patience to explore.</p>
                <p>Enough about that, though; <strong>what was the hackathon
                like</strong>?</p>
                <p>My team was composed of three other late-year students at
                <strong>McGill University</strong> in Montreal. While they were
                certainly significantly more knowledgeable than me in any field you
                could think of, our project’s frameworks were relatively new for them,
                too.</p>
                <p>We decided to make a website using <strong>React</strong> for local
                NGOs to track hotspots for <strong>urban heat islands</strong>. I refuse
                to explain urban heat islands anymore, I had to pitch this project too
                many damn times.</p>
                <p>But in short, it fell short of our expectations. The map structure
                took longer to implement than we thought, we barely had a working
                concept, and all I could contribute were the <strong>About</strong> and
                <strong>Contact Us</strong> pages. I managed to learn how to work with
                Mantine for web design, so that’s cool!</p>
                <p>Unfortunately, we didn’t really win anything or get as much as we
                wanted out of the experience. I’m still incredibly happy I went, though,
                because I learned what it feels like to work with a team on a project,
                and being on my own for the first time felt truly freeing.</p>
                <p>I planned for this section to be longer, but as time went on, my
                motivation to write more about this decreased. Onto something I’ve been
                planning for a while, but didn’t quite figure out until now!</p>
                <h3 class="subsection">Defining the Format</h3>
                <p>So as you might know, on the last <a href="/blog/2022/08/19.html">last blog post</a> I complained
                at length about my dissatisfaction with the overly technical approach I
                usually take. While I still think this is a fair criticism to take into
                consideration, I must rebutt that by saying that I was simply very tired
                of not being able to get anything done. On top of that, I was tired in
                general. But it was still indicative of something terribly, terribly
                wrong.</p>
                <p>Since then, I’ve taken a lot of time to reflect on where exactly I’ve
                gone wrong. I’ve watched <a
                href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pirdPK5avU">this video</a> about
                how 12tone would learn music theory if he had to learn it from scratch.
                While I certainly recognized that I’ve been trying to learn and do
                everything I can at breakneck speed, he has helped me realize that’s a
                massive understatement.</p>
                <p>Looking back, I can tell my focus has been on trying to get results
                when I want to be inquisitive, but also vice versa, strangely enough.
                <strong>Pacing my posts properly has been a challenge</strong>, simply
                put, and it’s impossible when my focus shifts between posts. I want them
                to be rigid yet flexible, mathematical yet digestible, complex and
                simple, everything yet nothing all at once. There’s no problem with
                flexibility, but it’s as if I’ve wanted the content to add up, to show my
                skills and dedication.</p>
                <p>I can identify two main problems with my blog posts: they
                <strong>don’t have structure</strong> and the topics are
                <strong>inconsistent</strong>. On top of that, I’ve been going through a
                bit of an identity crisis and calling into question my interest in the
                topics I write about.</p>
                <p>To solve these issues, I decided that I need to simultaneously expand
                my scope to get rid of feeling pigeonholed each time I choose a subject,
                and create a structure that isn’t too broad and doesn't give me decision
                paralysis.</p>
                <p>There will be <strong>three sections</strong> for each blog: the
                first will be <strong>personal updates</strong>, the second will always
                be <strong>exploring a scientific or technical concept I want</strong>,
                and the third will be about <strong>music</strong>. However, for very
                specific situations that wouldn’t happen often, I may combine the last
                two if they are <em>that</em> hand in hand.</p>
                <p>But you might be asking, <strong>why</strong>? Why separate these
                topics in this format, why these topics in particular? Most importantly,
                how will this help? To do that, let me step through them section by
                section.</p>
                <h4 class="subsection">Personal Updates</h4>
                <p>This is fairly self-explanatory. I’ve been providing personal updates
                near the end or at the beginning no matter what, and I enjoy sharing
                whatever I’m comfortable with! Out of all the categories, this one took
                the least effort to come up with.</p>
                <h4 class="subsection">Scientific/Technical Concept</h4>
                <p>You may notice the lack of a specific subject in the heading, and
                that’s the whole point. To give you a good idea as to why, I have a
                recent story.</p>
                <p>My boyfriend absolutely adores learning about and designing rockets.
                He’s been playing hours upon hours of <strong>Kerbal Space
                Program</strong> with realistic mods and overhauls to give him more
                control. But recently, he invited me over and wanted me to look at this
                document describing <strong>Unified Powered Flight Guidance</strong> and
                instructions to program it. Keep in mind it was from the ’70s, so it
                wasn’t exactly a good modern guide, but he wanted to come together with
                me and try to implement it using the <strong>kOS</strong> mod.</p>
                <p>I had an absolute blast trying to decipher that document. Considering
                I’ve been trying to read cryptic documents for the sake of the technical
                parts of my blog, I felt right at home reading the variables involved
                and how exactly you calculate each step. In fact, I even wanted to study
                it on my own, just for fun!</p>
                <p>But wait, I already have a technical blog to write about this on! Oh
                but… I’ve already said I wanted to study music technology for certain,
                and I’ve already gone through enough periods of self-doubt. So what’s a
                guy to do?</p>
                <p>This is a compromise that I hope satisfies myself going forward and
                anyone reading (if anyone even does read, I don’t use analytics). The
                topic isn’t set in stone and I can now comfortably change it from post
                to post.</p>
                <p>“But didn’t you just say you wanted to study <strong>music
                technology</strong>, not <strong>space</strong>? That’s part of the
                whole reason you started! Are you abandoning that idea and starting
                over?”</p>
                <p>I can’t lie, I was considering just announcing a change in course
                entirely. And the idea of that scared me so much that it led me to
                <em>really</em> take my time with this post. But in the end, I realize
                that no, I still love researching this; I just get uncomfortable with
                tunnel vision on a specific subject and I love taking a dive into other
                subjects from time to time. Plus, 90% of what’ll go into this section
                will either be <strong>computer science</strong>,
                <strong>space</strong>, or <strong>audio</strong> related in some form
                regardless, so I don’t think I’ll lose significant focus.</p>
                <p>One project in particular I wanted to work on was completing that
                damn <strong>JUCE plugin</strong>. I won’t feel obligated to talk about
                how filters work anymore or anything, and the post could be about the
                structure of the <strong>program</strong> rather than what exactly it
                does to audio. That’s just an idea, but the point is: I want to finally
                complete that.</p>
                <p>With that out of the way, the upcoming section is going to contain
                the biggest departure in content from before (though it’s a short
                explanation).</p>
                <h4 class="subsection">Music</h4>
                <p>So technically all of the posts I’ve made so far have been
                <em>tangentially</em> related to music. They all include processing
                audio signals, and one was even about the basics of using a synthesizer!
                But I think I’ve made a big mistake not putting more emphasis on the
                <strong>music theory</strong> side; music isn’t just about what you use
                to make it, but also the creative decisions you make on the way.</p>
                <p>Plus, I’ve never really had much strength in music theory, and that
                has <em>definitely</em> held me back each time I sit down intending to
                create something for a change. I want to learn more about music outside
                of what algorithms are best for equalizers or the best compressors for
                certain drums, and that’s why I’m separating the
                <strong>technology</strong> and the <strong>theory</strong> going
                forward.</p>
                <h3 class="subsection">Conclusion</h3>
                <p>So yeah! That’s how I want to do things going forward, and I feel
                good about it. I’m not sure what else I could add here, and I need to
                get back to school work, so I’ll see y’all later!</p>
